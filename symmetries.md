### Abelian Symmetry of a Hamiltonian
We have some symmetries $\{X_i\}$ of the Full NRG Hamiltonian. 

Then 
$H = H_1 + H_2$ the individual Hamiltonian
is $H^{X_k} = H^{X_i}_1 + H^{X_j}_2$.  

Provided ${X_k} = {X_i} + {X_j}$. One Important thing to remember is that
there may be more than one combination of $\{X_i,X_j\}$ which 
can give the same $\{X_k\}$. We have to collect all those combinations
of $H^{X_i}_1$ and $H^{X_j}_2$ to construct the $H^{X_k}$.
